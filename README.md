### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. According to the Document Object Model (DOM), the Document object refers to the entire webpage displayed in a browser.  The Document object contains all of the elements of the webpage, and JavaScrpit represents each element as its own object.
2. One can access elements in the Document object through the use of methods similar to getElementById().  Elements may also be accessed by name, tag name, and class name.
3. The Document Object Model contains methods which allow new elements to be created in, added to, and removed from the DOM tree.  The methods to do that, respectively, are createElement(), appendChild(), and removeNode().
